use props/ slots to transport data between pages. Local
storage will not be good enough. Interactive data is very easy since we use
ref arrays of our stuff. Just need to add a addUser/addWorkout function
to our models and remove functions as well. Very easy to just remove an array
element may not even need an extra function for that. Surly will need one
to add an item to the array.
